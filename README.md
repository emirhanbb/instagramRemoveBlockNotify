# Instagram Remove Block Notify

Hello, there is a user who has blocked your instagram account. This user is someone you know. Don't you want to know when this user unblocks you ?

This python program checks the account you want to check for 20 seconds. If the user unblocks it, it is registered in the data file.
***In a nutshell, I wrote a small bot using python selenium.***

# Working Logic

This program I wrote with python selenium logs into your instagram account through the browser. In the search box, it writes the user name associated with the 20-second dec dec. If the search result is not found, the other party has blocked it. If the search result is found, dec counter party has unblocked you.
In order for the program to work, your computer must be constantly turned on.
